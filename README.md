# TwitterDelete
TwitterDelete is a small application to delete your old, unpopular tweets.

## Features
- Delete, unfavorite and unretweet tweets
- Keep tweets based on age, retweet or favourite count
- Delete tweets no longer exposed by Twitter API from a downloaded Twitter archive file

## Usage
To setup locally run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikemcquaid/TwitterDelete
cd TwitterDelete
bundle install
```

Get the Twitter API variables from https://apps.twitter.com and add the following variables to a `.env` file in the `TwitterDelete` folder:
```bash
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=...
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=...
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=...
```

Now run TwitterDelete:
```bash
./twitter_delete.rb --user TwitterUsername
```

## Status
Still a work-in-progress but works for deleting the relevant tweets. I may turn this into a web application.

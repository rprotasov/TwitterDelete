# TwitterDelete

## A note
Thanks to [Mike McQuaid](https://github.com/mikemcquaid) for creating the initial script of this app and mentioning the idea
of turning it into a functional app.

You can see the beginnings of the app and instructions at [mike's repository](https://github.com/mikemcquaid/TwitterDelete).

## What's to come
Although this is all yet to be implemented here's a basic guideline of what is to come! Visiting the site allows you
to enter your twitter credentials and provides available options you can customize such as:
- An actual website
- Deleting, unfavoriting and unretweeting tweets
- Keeping tweets based on age, retweet or favorite count
- Deleting tweets no longer exposed by Twitter API from a downloaded Twitter archive file
- Opposed to manually entering constraints you can allow the app to decided what's not *savvy* enough and remove it.
